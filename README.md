DESCRIPTION: 
        
This project includes an SQLite database used for managing various entities within a clinic management system. The database contains multiple tables including:
        
        Admin: Stores information about administrators, including their full names and phone numbers.
        
        Clinic: Holds data on clinics, including clinic names, addresses, and contact details.
        
        Department: Organizes departments within the clinics, specifying the type of department (medical, administrative, etc.).
        
        Medical: Includes medical staff members' information, such as their full names, phone numbers, and associated departments.
        
        Paramedic: Holds information about paramedic staff and their departments.
        
Each table includes sample data that simulates real-world entries within a clinic setting. This database can be used as the backend for applications that manage clinic resources and staff.
